        Thanks to The Open University, online learning is a part of many
        institutions' course offerings around the world. From certificates,
        PhDs, impactful online language learning and everything in between,
        learning online has never been so easy! Offered by some of the world's
        top-ranked institutions, online learning offers you all the perks of
        attending your dream university, with the added convenience of a
        learning experience tailored to your schedule. With courses available in
        almost every subject, and flexible timetables to suit almost every
        lifestyle, students are increasingly turning to online learning as a
        viable alternative to on-campus study. It could allow you to study
        abroad remotely, at a university not in your home country! The Open
        University now allow students to study entirely online while still
        socializing with classmates, watching lectures and participating in
        subject-specific discussions. While some consider online learning to
        require a greater degree of self-motivation, institutions recognize that
        educational support is just as important as tutor feedback, and take
        great care to ensure that their students receive the same levels of
        support that they would receive on campus. Online learning is the future
        of education, discover how it works and why it could be the perfect
        study abroad option for you!
